The Drake Equation
“How many communicative civilizations are there currently in our galaxy?”

This calculator runs multiple calculations of the Drake Equation and uses a Monte Carlo simulation
for all the parameters except the FI parm which I leave at 1%.
I have run simulations of 1 to 10 million and the average result is usually in the 7,000 - 8,000 range.
Meaning the equation shows that potentially 7 to 8 thousand advanced civilizations exist currently in our galaxy.

Details:


N = R∗ × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L

The Drake Equation is calculated by multiplying the following:
1)     R* - stars made in the Milky Way galaxy in one year,
2)     Fp - the fraction of stars that have planets,
3)     Ne - the fraction of those planets where life can exist,
4)     FL - the fraction of those planets where life does exist,
5)     FI - the fraction of those planets where intelligent life exists,
6)     FC - the fraction of those intelligent aliens who develop technology that is able to communicate outside of their own planet,
7)     L - number of years an intelligent, communicating civilization lasts.

Here is an example from one astrobiologist:
1)     R* = 10 (astronomers know roughly 10 stars are made per year)
2)     Fp = 100 % (nearly all stars have planets)
3)     N3 = 25 % (life can exist in very harsh environments - it would make sense that life could exist on a number of planets)
4)     FL = 100 % (if life can exist, it will)
5)     FI = 1 % (not all life will become intelligent)
6)     FC = 50 % (most intelligent life will be able to invent communication technology such as radio)
7)     L = 1,000,000 years (intelligent life will exist for a long time)
